# Magic-Collection-Manager
Utility application for players of the card game Magic:the Gathering

This is currently a very basic utility application. The current features it has are:
  ability to cache mid prices from tcgplayer.com
  input and keep track of your collection
  comparison of two lists of cards for trading
  picture display when you click on a card
  
I have several features in mind to improve this project
  modo prices from supernova bots (http://supernovabots.com/prices_0.txt)
  ability to do deckbuilding
    restrict cards to ones you own
    tell you how much you would have to spend to complete a deck
    enforce format rules for deckbuilding
  add to trade system
    trades can add and remove cards from your inventory
    keep track of trades over time to see if you profited or lost money
  keep a database of card prices over time
    I might be able to pull data from a third party source
  Improve the UI
